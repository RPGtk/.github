This organization contains several repositories, all of which are components of the wider Waterlily toolset. The entire toolset is written in [C23](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C23_(C_standard_revision)), using [CMake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake) as a [build system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_system_(software_development)). The [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) editor is included under [`editor`](), while the actual engine is under [`engine`](https://github.com/waterlily-team/engine). All other repositories contain items such as [windowing abstractions](https://github.com/waterlily-team/window), [graphical helpers](https://github.com/waterlily-team/vulkan), and other engine-related components.

If you have any questions, please contact the project via our [business e-mail](mailto:waterlilyproject@protonmail.com).
